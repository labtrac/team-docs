This will open a new window.

Enter the **Amount**, **Payment Date** and choose whether to **Include Discount** (select this if you are giving any discount on the outstanding invoices).

Select if the **Payment Type** is **Cheque**, **BACS** or **Credit Note**.

Enter a **Reference** and **Details**.

Then go through and tick every invoice in the list which the payment covers. If the payment does not clear an invoice you can either leave the invoice with a balance or discount the remaining amount. This is done by selecting **Include Discount** after entering the **Amount** and **Payment Date**.
