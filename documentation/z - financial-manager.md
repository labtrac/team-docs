# Financial Manager 
(May have to change with new version of FM also add monthly invoice implications)



Financial Manager is a program that runs alongside Labtrac and allows you to ammend completed jobs Labtrac does not.



To open Financial Manager click **Support** in the very top left then **Financial Manager**.



You can then search for any job and change any infomation you want.



You wont find the job in the list if it is older than 3 months old or has had a payment posted against it. If the latter is the case please [Reverse Payments](payment-entry#4.2) against the invoice.



+ Use the search bar to find the relevant job/invoice. 



+ Once you have found the invoice double click to open the infomation screen.



+ In here you can change:



	- Order Status

		- To change the order status select from the dropdown menu the status you would like to set the job to and click *Update* in the bottom right. (Note: Changing the status of a job will delete the previous invoice and create a new one)

	- Dentist

		-  Select the correct dentist from the dropdown menu and click *update*. (This will delete the old invoice and create a new one)

	- Order Details

		- To change a product select the product in the order details box and change it using the dropdown menu. Once the correct product is selected in the dropdown menu click the green tick and then *Update*.

	- Patient infomation
