# Labtrac Installation

When we need to Install Labtrac, carry out any training or resolve any issues we use TeamViewer. TeamViewer is a piece of software that allows us to remotely access your system, with your permission.

To install TeamViewer please follow these steps.

* Go to labtrac.com/en/support

* Under support click ***Labtrac Remote Support Client***. This will start a download of the software. When that has downloaded 'Run' the Installer.

* Follow the instructions and go through the installer.

* When it asks for a PC name please enter your lab name to allow us to find you in our list of PC's.

* Enter a password. Please dont make this a personal password as you will need to tell the members of the Labtrac Support team.

* This Process will take 4 or 5 minutes for each PC.

Once the TeamViewer link is available, the Labtrac Support Team can then proceed to install the latest Labtrac version on your PC and this will take around 20-30 minutes depending on internet speeds and the modules that you have taken.
