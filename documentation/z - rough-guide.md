<a name="0"></a>Welcome to Labtrac



Thank you for choosing Labtrac and welcome to the Labtrac family of over 200 Laboratories in the UK who have run their systems successfully over the last 20 years.



This document is to give you a guide to the implementation process so you know the sequence of events and particularly what you will need to prepare for.



Some contact numbers that you will find useful;



**Labtrac Support/Sales - 03333 449970**

***(all calls charged at local rate)***





These Numbers are available during 9:00 to 5:30 Monday to Thursday and 9:00 to 5:00 on Fridays, excluding Bank Holidays.



If any issue is non-urgent then it is best to contact us using the **support@labtrac.com** email, explaining what the issue is and providing any details that you can, as well as Contact names etc. When we need to carry out any training or need to access your system to resolve any issues we have invested in the TeamViewer software package and this allows us to access your system with your permission.





###<a name=0.1></a>Installation of the Labtrac Software



* Firstly you need to install TeamViewer on all PC's which will have Labtrac on. To do this please follow these instructions.



+ Open an internet browser and go to labtrac.com



* Click on the tap in the top right corner called *Support*.



+ Now in this page you will see *Support* again in the middle of the page. Under this it will say *Labtrac Remote Support Client* click this link and it will start a download which you can say *Run* to.



* This will then open the *TeamViewer* Installer. The first thing you will need to enter in this page is *How do you want to use TeamViewer* to which you should select *Both of the above*.



+ Next it will ask you to agree to the tearms of the license.



+ Once you have agreed it will then ask for a password. This should be a password which you can tell the Labtrac Support team.



+ After you have entered the Password then change the name of the PC to your lab name **eg. Knutsford Dental-PC 1** and click *Finish*



* This Process will take 4 or 5 minutes for each PC.



* Once the TeamViewer link is available, the Labtrac Support Team can then proceed to install the latest Labtrac version on your PC and this will take around 20-30 minutes depending on broadband speeds and the modules that you have taken. Once this has been completed we can then start the Labtrac data build stage.



## Getting Started



###<a name=1.1></a name> Access to Labtrac



By clicking on the Labtrac icon on your desktop you will be presented with the Labtrac sign on screen. Key in the user name, press tab then enter the password. By default both these fields are set to ‘sys’.

###<a name=1.2></a>Data Build



####<a name=1.2a></a> Things to Consider Before Getting Started



Now you have Labtrac set up on your PC(s) you will need to enter all your data (Dentists, Product etc). Following is a step by step guide to do that.





#####<a name=1.2b></a>Price Lists



It is important that before you start entering any infomation that you have in mind your price lists that are used throughout your whole customer base. If you have 3 price lists then when you are entering dentists you will need to know which price list that dentist is on. Likewise when entering any products or material you will need to know every price for that product or material.



#####<a name=1.3></a>Dentist Codes



Every dentist in Labtrac needs a unique code. If you already have a coding system that you use then you can carry on with that system. If you dont we reccomend using the first 4 letters of the surname followed by 01 incase of duplicates.



+ Labtrac allows a dentist code of up to 10 characters, however, if you are planning on exporting your accounts, Sage will only allow up to 8 characters.



	- **WRIG01** - Owen Wright

	- **WRIG02** - Michael Wright



#####<a name=1.2b></a>Product Codes



When setting up product codes in Labtrac there are a few things you have to bear in mind;





+ There needs to be a product code for every standard of work that you do. Meaning if you do NHS,Independent and Private work you will need 3 codes for each product. In the example below we have suffixed the same *PBC* (for a Porcelain Bonded Crown) code with a N,I or P depending on the Standard.



	- **PBC-N** for (NHS) Porcelain Bonded Crown.

	- **PBC-I** for (Independent) Porcelain Bonded Crown.

	- **PBC-P** for (Private Porcelain) Bonded Crown.

###<a name=1.4b></a>Delivery Methods



* To set up our delivery methods (how the dentists recieve the work) you first need to double click on *Delivery Details* from the content bar.



* This then opens a new window which will be blank. To set up a delivery method click *Add* in the bottom left of the screen.



* Again, this will open a new window from here you need to select a few parameters. you need to select the *Run* number.



* Next you select the *Days* this is the amount of time you want to allow for the job to arrive in surgery after leaving the Lab.



* Now you will go down and write some details in the *Delivery Method* section(eg Postal, Courier, Hand Delivered etc)



* The *Rep* and *Sales Area* boxes are additional infomation you can add if you have/need it. It is not needed to set up a *Run*.



In our example we have created run number 1, allowed for 2 days and have named the method Postal. 



![Delivery Method Video](C:\Users\dannysitunes\SharePoint\Home - Shared Documents\Support\Labtrac Manual\Media\Delivery Method.PNG)





##<a name=1.4></a>Adding Dentists



* To add a dentist you need to click on *Dentist* in the contents bar.



* Now either click *Add* on the top or F2 to bring up the next screen.



* By now you should have have an idea for your dentist codes. Enter that into the *Dentist Code* section and then the full name under *Dentist Name*.



* Here you are met with a few different options. First off you can enter an address.



* Next you need to select the Dentsist as either a Principal (they handle their own payments and account) or an associate (they have a Principal who handles all payments and account infomation). If they are an associate you can select the principal, once they have been added to Labtrac, from the dropdown menu.



* Now we will look at the Invoicing section. The first box under the address box is *Invoiced*. If the Dentist is set as a principal then this box will always be selected. If it is an associate then you can choose whether or not they are invoiced. If you dont select this box all invoices will be sent to the Principal rather than this dentist.



* Next we have *Invoice on Delivery* if this box is checked then an invoice is sent with every job, and a Statement sent at the end of the month. If this box is not checked then there will be no invoice sent with the job, maybe a job ticket or delivery note instead, and a consolidated invoice sent at the end of the month detailing all jobs completed within that month.



* Next you will select the *Run*. This is the delivery method which you set up earlier. Click on the dropdown menu and select from your list.



* Next you can go to the *Contacts* tab here you can enter the contact name and contact number. This is just for your reference.



* Then click on the *Financial* tab and you need to enter a Invoice Address. If the Invoice address is the same as the one you entered on the Details screen you can click the button next to *Invoice Address* to copy it across.



* After entering the address you can go to the email tab. Here you can enter the Dentists email and select some in the preference menu which documents you would like to email.



* Now you can click *OK* and the surgeon is entered.



**Here is a video showing all the steps above...**

##<a name=1.5></a>Products?????????





##<a name=1.5></a>Adding a Product



To add a product fist click on the *Master Products* section in the contents bar. Then click *Add* or F2 to bring up the *New Item* window.



Now you can enter a Product Code and Description and click *Add*. 



This brings up a new window with a few options. 



If this is the first time adding a product you need to set up our *Standard* and *Category*. This is something you will only need to do the first time. At the moment they will have a dropdown box which says *All*. To add to this do the following;



* First click the dotted box next to the dropdown for *Standard*. This will open a new window.



* Next you can type in the *Standard* you would like to set up, in the example we have used *NHS*, *Independent* and *Private*, then click *Add*.



Now you need to do the same for *Categories* 



* First click the dotted box next to the dropdown for *Categories*. This will open a new window.



* Next you need to type in the *Categories* you would like to set up, in the example you have used *Crown and Bridge*, *Prosthetics*, *Orthodontics* and *Misc*. Then click *Add*.



Now going back to the original *Add Product* window you can fill this out;



+ If you select tooth, stump or tooth mould shade required boxes Labtrac will then not allow you to enter a job without this infomation filled out.



+ Record Material is a section where you can attach a material to a product. Click [here](#1.3b) for more infomation.



* Choose your *Standard* and *Category*.



+ Next enter a price for every [Price List](#1.1.5) that you use, even if the price (for this particular product) doesnt change throughout. If you dont enter any infomation on one of your price lists yet you have a dentist set to that list the product will go onto a job with a value of £0.00.



* Click *OK* and the product has been entered.



**Here is a video showing all the steps above**



![Delivery Method Video](C:\Users\dannysitunes\SharePoint\Home - Shared Documents\Support\Labtrac Manual\Media\Adding a Product.mp4)





##<a name=1.6></a>Adding Materials



Now we are going to go through adding materials. In our example we are adding Gold Alloy.



* First go to Materials in the Contents bar.



* Click *Add* or F2 and this will bring up a new window.



* Enter a *Material Code* and *Description*, You may already have your own material code in the example, however, we have used *PGOLD60* for Private Gold Alloy 60%, then click *Add*.



This will have opened a new window where you can enter more details;



* We then move to *Standard* where in our cast we select *Private*.



* Then we have the prices which again go from 1 - 40. We have entered 3 different price structures.



* Click *OK* and the Material has been added.





####<a name=1.3b></a>Attaching a Material to a Product



In our example we have create a Full Gold Crown as a product. This product will always need our Material we then created, Gold Alloy. Now we will show you how to link the two together.



* Go into Master Products in the content bar and either select an existing product or create a new one.



* When we open the product you will see a unchecked box *Record Material* and a dropdown menu. Check the box and select from the dropdown the Material you want to add to the product.



* Click *OK* and that is now added.



Now when it comes to completing a job Labtrac will not allow you to do so without entering the amount, in our case grams, of material used.





* * *





###<a name=1.7></a>Adding a Job



####<a name=1.7b></a>Entering a Job



Now we will look at adding a job. To add a new job firstly click on 'Live Jobs' in the contents bar.



* To add a new job click this will then open a new window.



* The first thing to do in this new window is enter the patients details.



* Next, on the right hand side, we have the *Surgeon* details.



* Select the surgeon from the dropdown menu and the rest will fill in automatically.



* Next you need to enter your recieved and due dates. Labtrac assumes the date received is todays date. Then select the date the work is due in surgery by using the drop down menu and selecting from the calendar.



* We will then go to the *Product* button or *F7*. this will open a new window which will have all the products that we have set up. Select your product from the list, you can search through the list by typing the product code. Then click *OK*.



* Now the job is ready to *Launch* do this by clicking the Launch button or F11.



####Completing the Job<a name=1.7c></a>





Now we will work through completing the job.



* Open up a job that is ready to be completed.



*  Click on the *Task* button or F10.



* This is where you can change the status of a job in Labtrac to a few different things. Such as the work being *Out on Approval* (see [Stage Work](#1.7d)), *Surgeon Return* (see [Stage Work](#1.7d)), *Hold Job*, *Sub Contract* (see Sub Contracting) a job and *Complete Job*.



* Click *Complete Job* this will set the job as completed and produce an invoice and all relevant documents.



* Now in the window under quantity we can enter the amount you used, in our case it was per gram and in the example we have used 2.5g. That will then calculate the total cost and we can *Save* and *Continue* and the Job is complete.



####<a name=1.7d></a>Stage Work



Now we are going to go through staging a job.





* The first thing you need to do is to go into *Live Jobs* and click *Add* or F2 to open a new job.



* Go through all the normal steps for adding a job here.



* Launch the job.



* When the job is ready to be sent out to the dentist for approval you need to reopen the live job. Then you can click *Task* or F10. This will then bring up a dropdown menu. From this select *Send on Approval*. This now tells Labtrac that the job is out with the dentist and no longer in the lab.



* When we receive the work back from the dentist and you are ready to move onto the next stage you can open the job back up and again go to *Task* or F10 and select *Surgeon Return*. It will now prompt you to change the date the work is due back in surgery.



* Now you can **add the new stage** to do this we need to click on the *stage* tab (left of product button) or F5 this now brings up the products and from here you can select which ever may apply for the second stage.



* Now you are ready to send the work back into the lab which we do by clicking *Launch* or F11.



* Again once the work in the lab is complete and ready to be sent back to the dentist you have to reopen the job and select *Send on Approval*.



* When you receive the work back from the dentist you can go back into the job and into *Task* F10 and click *Surgeon return* then select *Stage* and choose from the product list.



* You can now launch this job and when work is complete in the lab you can then go through and complete the job as normal.



####<a name=1.7e></a>Sub Contracting



To Sub Contract a job in Labtrac first you need to set up a list of Subcontracters. 



+ Double click *Sub-Contracters* in the contents bar. This will open up a new window where you can enter all of the people you sub-contract work to.



+ Click *Add* and fill in the relevant infomation, making sure to add a *Run* then select *Save*.



+ Now you have your sub contracters set up you can go through and enter a job like normal, however, once you launch the job click on *Task* or F10 and select **Sub-Contract** then **Send Out** (This changes the Job Status to *Sub Contract* ). Now select the date that the work is due back to you. 



+ When you recieve the work back again go to **Sub Contract** and select **Recieve Back**.
